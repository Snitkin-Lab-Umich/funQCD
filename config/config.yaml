# This directory needs to have a specific structure:
# lib
# ├—rna_seq_data
# ├—eggnog_data
# ├—busco
#     └-lineages
#       └-saccharomycetes_odb10

# You can create this file structure in your working directory and the setup rules will download the relevant databases
# This will likely require you to set up the funannotate database separately.

# This is an example QC summary file used as a template. It's used to indicate that certain samples fail early steps in the pipeline.
# The first row should contain a failed sample, and the second row should contain a passing sample.
# These columns should be identical to the final QC file produced by the pipeline.
